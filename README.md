## Terms of Service

I do not claim to offer any support whatsoever, please do not expect it. If you find your experience
with one of my drivers lacking feel free to either fork it or [contribute here](#contributing).

## Contributing

If you find a bug or would like to see a feature added to any drivers housed here, please open an
[issue](/FreeMasen/SmartThingsEdgeDrivers/issues). The subject of all issues should begin with the
name of the driver to which it applies. If you would like to implement that fix/feature please indicate
that fact in your issue. All pull requests will be considered but it would be good to clear the work
as something I would be willing to merge before spending too much time there.

I am not getting paid to work on these drivers, they are fully maintained in my free time so please
be patient.

## Code of Conduct

I will strive to treat all who communicate here with respect and I expect the same from anyone else
who chooses to communicate here. Please expect the [contributor covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
to be followed here.
